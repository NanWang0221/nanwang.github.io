The issue of ontological challenges, such as the jingle-jangle fallacy, is regarded as one of the reasons for the replication crisis in psychology, describing a lack of clarity in the use of terms and constructs. Few attempts have been made to provide a structured framework to identify these challenges and potential remedies. The aim of this unconference is to (1) raise awareness of ontological challenges, (2) produce a first collection of ideas to address them, and (3) establish connections between researchers of different fields to implement the session-insights in interdisciplinary projects.
